# VueJS Star Wars Demo

## How to run
Once downloaded run the below commands

```
npm i
npm run serve
```
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/

## What is it?

A simple VueJS app that is using a JSON list of Star Wars characters to display them on screen, for each generates a card with the character's info and films.

You can filter them by name and choose your favourites to add to your own list that can be viewed in a separate page.

## Improvements

- Better apply Vue's life-cycle methods and design patterns, once I have more knowledge!
- Connect the app to a DB to store a user's favourites between sessions by implementing authentication
- Use a centralized store for the data, like Vuex
